## Jenkins Shared Pipeline Library
This is an open-source Jenkins Shared Library repository designed to centralize and reuse pipeline code across multiple Jenkins projects. It includes a growing collection of reusable functions, custom steps, and deployment utilities for modern CI/CD workflows — including Kubernetes deployments, Docker builds, and more.

You’re welcome to explore, use, and contribute!
We aim to make this library more powerful and flexible over time, so feel free to submit pull requests, raise issues, or suggest improvements.
